# Telecom Churn Case Study

## Problem Statement
● Schuster is a multinational retail company specializing in sports
goods and accessories.
● The company has credit arrangements with hundreds of vendors.
● Some vendors fail to respect credit terms and make late payments.
● Schuster imposes heavy late payment fees, which are not beneficial
for long-term business relationships.
● Employees spend time chasing vendors for on-time payments,
leading to non-value-added activities, time loss, and financial impact.
● Schuster aims to understand customers' payment behavior and
predict the likelihood of late payments on open invoices.

## Business Goal
● Understand customers' payment behavior
through past patterns (customer segmentation).
● Predict likelihood of delayed payments using
historical data.
● Enable collectors to prioritize follow-ups for timely
payments.

## The Steps:
1. Read and understand the data.
2. Clean the data:
● Delete null values.
● Drop columns with only one value.
● Remove duplicated columns.
● Eliminate columns not important for analysis.
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis:
● Check data imbalance.
● Create derived metrics (e.g., overdue_days, credit_period).
4. Cluster the data.
5. Prepare the data:
● Treat outliers.
● Generate dummy variables.
● Scale features.
● Split into train and test sets.
6. Build the model.
7. Evaluate the model.
8. Conclude findings.
